/**
 * Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days,
 * the task is to find the maximum profit possible for buying and selling the stocks on different days using transactions
 * where at most one transaction is allowed.
 * Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
 *
 * Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6.
 * Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5.
 *
 * Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1}
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: Since the array is in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem
